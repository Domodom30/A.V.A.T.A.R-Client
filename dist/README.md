## 🚀 New Features and Improvements

### ✨ New Features
- **[Interface ]**: New Interface with Xel-toolkit. 
- **[Voice Rule]**: Call a voice rule directly without necessarily triggering listening through the keyword. Note that this feature requires configuring direct-call rules on each client.  
- **[Plugin Audit]**: New `Audit` command accessible from `Plugin Studio`. This command verifies the integrity of all plugins with `npm` packages. It generates a report on security vulnerabilities and outdated versions of the packages requiring updates. The command also provides an option to update these packages when possible.  
- **[Information]**: New `Information` command accessible from the application menu. This command checks the integrity of A.V.A.T.A.R.'s `npm` packages. It generates a report on security vulnerabilities and outdated versions of the packages requiring updates.  
- **[Version Log]**: The update process now displays a summary log of the new application version's changes.
